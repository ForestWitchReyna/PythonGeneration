Project Background:

The project was requested by a client running a pop-up cafe offering home-made food and drinks to local offices. 
As such they needed a software application to enable them to log and track orders.




**Client Requirements:**

**The clients requirements include-**

The ability to maintain a collection of products and couriers
The ability to create a new order on the system
To update the status of an order, such as being out for delivery, or cancelled.
To have all data persist upon closing of the app
To be able to load previously saved data upon opening the app
For the app to be tested and proven to work correctly
To recieve regular software updates.



**How the design meets the project's requirements:**

These requirements are currently met by the use of lists and dictionaries to store collections
of products, orders, customer details and couriers. There is also the ability to correctly create and update orders
as well as the app having been tested and working as currently intended



**How the projects requirements were guaranteed:**

The current project requirements that are implemented have been guaranteed through thorough testing of each function,
as well as the implementation of robust input validation functions to minimise any risk of user incurred errors.



**If I had more to time what I would improve:**

If I had more time I would have worked more on the data persistance requirements to ensure data could be properly stored
and accessed through the application as well as merging the various listing functions that are used into a single flexible
function that could be used through out the program.



**What I enjoyed implementing the most:**

Rather than implementation necessarily, I greatly enjoyed the process of writing the inital code, then going back and optimising
and cleaning it up, such as implementing validation loops as flexible functions that can be used by other parts of the program. In addition
I enjoyed tidying up the various menu loops into individual functions for better readability.
