Project Background:

The project was requested by a client running a pop-up cafe offering home-made food and drinks to local offices. 
As such they needed a software application to enable them to log and track orders.

Your client has launched a pop-up caf√© in a busy business district. They
are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding
offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders.


Client Requirements:

The clients requirements include-

The ability to maintain a collection of products and couriers
The ability to create a new order on the system
To update the status of an order, such as being out for delivery, or cancelled.
To have all data persist upon closing of the app
To be able to load previously saved data upon opening the app
For the app to be tested and proven to work correctly
To recieve regular software updates.

These requirements are currently met by the use lists and dictionaries to store collections
of products, orders, customer details and couriers. There is also the ability to correctly create and update orders
as well as the app having been tested and working as currently intended
